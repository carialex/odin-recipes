<p>Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour sauce scattered with crushed peanuts. It’s made with thin, flat rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, scrambled egg, firm tofu and a protein.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <p>
      <ul>
          <li>10 ounces thin rice noodles</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded carrots</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 eggs, whisked</li>
            <li>3 green onions, sliced into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>toppings: lots of chopped peanuts, extra crushed red pepper flakes, fresh lime wedges</li>
        </ul>
            
            <h4>SAUCE INGREDIENTS:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>       
            <li>2 tablespoons tamarind concentrate</li>            
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>juice of 1 fresh lime</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (or more/less to taste)</li>
            </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Make the sauce. Whisk all ingredients together in a medium bowl (or shake together in a mason jar) until completely combined.  Set aside until ready to use.</li>
          <li>Cook the noodles. Cook the noodles al dente according to package instructions.  Drain the noodles in a strainer, then rinse with cold water briefly to halt their cooking.  Toss briefly with one tablespoon oil to prevent the noodles from sticking.</li>
          <li>Cook the chicken (or see other protein options below). Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan or wok over high heat. Add the chicken and sauté for 3-5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a clean plate and set aside.</li>
          <li>Cook the veggies. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the sauté pan, along with the bean sprouts, carrots, and garlic.  Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Cook the eggs. Push the veggies to one side of the pan and add the whisked eggs on the other side.  Cook the eggs until scrambled, stirring often.</li>
          <li>Put it all together. Now add everything back in with the eggs and veggies — the cooked noodles, cooked chicken, sauce and green onions. Give the mixture a good toss until everything is evenly coated in the sauce.  Remove pan from heat.</li>
          <li>Serve. Serve immediately, sprinkled with lots of crushed peanuts, extra crushed red pepper flakes (if desired) and a good squeeze of fresh lime juice. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
