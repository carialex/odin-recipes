        Paella, pronounced pay-EH-yah! is a rice dish made in a shallow, wide pan over an open fire. Paella means “frying pan” in Valencian. Traditionally, paella includes short grain rice, green beans, rabbit, chicken, and saffron, but nowadays there are a huge number of variations, from seafood to vegetarian. I made a mixta paella here, which is essentially a mixed paella that has meat, seafood, and vegetables.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
            <li>30 threads saffron lightly crushed, about 1/2 tsp</li>
            <li>1/4 cup neutral oil high</li>
            <li>2 links Spanish chorizo sliced</li>
            <li>4 bone in skin on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>10-12 large shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 small onion minced, about 1 cup</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic crushed</li>
            <li>3 medium tomatoes diced or grated, about 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth no sodium preferred</li>
            <li>2.5 cups bomba rice</li>
            <li>1 red or orange pepper sliced into 1" strips</li>
            <li>12 clams</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the saffron into 1⁄4 cup hot water in a small bowl and let bloom for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a 16″–18″ paella pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and the chicken, skin side down. Add the the shrimp and cook, flipping occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes, then transfer the shrimp to a plate, leaving the meats to sear in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic, tomatoes, and paprika and cook, stirring often, until the onions soften, about 6 minutes. Add the saffron and 4 cups of chicken stock. Flip the chicken so it’s skin side up and bring everything to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle in the rice, distributing evenly, then add the peppers on top. Cook, uncovered, without stirring, until rice has absorbed most of the liquid, about 12-15 minutes. If the pan is larger than the burner, rotate it every two minutes to evenly distribute the heat. Once the stock is low enough, add the remaining 2 cups chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, and top with the cooked shrimp. Nestle in the clams, hinge side down. Continue to cook, without covering or stirring, until the clams opened and the rice absorbs the liquid and is al dente, 5–10 minutes more. Turn heat to high for 1-2 minutes to create the socarrat. Remove pan from heat, cover with aluminum foil, and let sit for 5 minutes before enjoying.</li>
